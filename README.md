# Power-BI-Cleaner-MS
**Power BI Cleaner - Manga Solutions Edition**

[Power BI Cleaner](https://www.thebiccountant.com/tools-power-bi-cleaner/) was a tool developed up to 2022 by [Imke Feldmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/imkefeldmann), as a solution for exploring the used and unused objects within a Power BI Report.

Power BI Cleaner itself was released as a Power BI Template, which made it effectively open for anyone to customise. To help solve problems for the clients of my [Manga Solutions](www.mangasolutions.com) consulting practice, we made a few enhancements and added a new **Usage** page.  That work is the starting point for this GitHub project. 

## Usage page

[![Click to view and interact with the report](https://github.com/Mike-Honey/Power-BI-Cleaner-MS/blob/main/PBI-Cleaner-Gen2-V7-MS-Usage-Page.png?raw=true)](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMDIwZGFhOGEtMGI4Yi00YmY4LWExZDYtOGMxNzgwNjgyNzliIiwidCI6ImRjMWYwNGY1LWMxZTUtNDQyOS1hODEyLTU3OTNiZTQ1YmY5ZCIsImMiOjEwfQ%3D%3D)

The intended use of the **Usage** page is to quickly scan the connections between pages, visuals, tables, fields and measures, in any direction. Selecting any entry of any type will cross-filter all the other objects.  For example selecting a Page object will cross filter to show all the visuals on that page, and the tables, fields and measures that they reference. By contrast, selecting a Field  object will cross-filter to show the pages and visuals where it is used, and it's home table.

The format is intended for "business analyst" types and other non-technical users. As the solution is a Power BI report, it can be published or shared via SharePoint or OneDrive, for instant access without even needing to open the source PBIX/PBIP file.  If you need to extend it further, the existing page can offer a guide to the elements of the Cleaner's own semantic model.

## How-To

The Power BI Cleaner blog post goes through the instructions in detail, but I can offer this condensed "How-To" guide, to use this solution against your own PBIX file:

1. Open the target PBIX file in [Power BI Desktop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/power-platform/products/power-bi/desktop)
2. Make a copy of the Power BI Cleaner PBIX file in this solution. I use a file name prefix that matches the target file, to avoid confusion. Open that PBIX file also.
3. In the Power BI Cleaner file window, navigate to **Transform data / Edit parameters**.
4. To get the value for the **PortNumber** parameter, open the target PBIX file using Power BI Desktop and navigate to **Model View / Data / Model** and choose the **Semantic model** node.  Then look in the **Properties** pane for the **Server** property, and hit the **Copy value** button. After pasting into this parameter, edit to remove "localhost:"
5. To get the value for the **ReportFile** parameter in quoted form, use Windows Explorer to navigate to the target PBIX file, then right-click and choose **Copy as path**.
6. Hit **Apply Changes**.
7. After a few seconds, you will see the usual Credentials pop-up appear, titled **Access SQL Server Analysis Services**.  Leave it on the default method of **Windows **and choose **Connect**.
8. Wait for the queries to refresh, then save your Power BI Cleaner PBIX file.
9. Close your target PBIX file.

## Discussion

There are several other tools around now to help with similar tasks, and some of them have more features. This [article by SQLBI](https://www.sqlbi.com/articles/tools-in-power-bi/) gives a handy summary and describes each one. But those tools are mostly specific apps that must be installed and/or licensed, and they usually require some preparation work using Power BI Desktop before any results can be reviewed. Most are quite technical in style, not aimed at a "business analyst" / non-technical audience. None can be extended, customised or shared as easily as a PBIX file. So I believe there is still a niche for this solution.

The sample PBIX file provided was pointed at my favourite demo file, the [Miradi template](https://github.com/Mike-Honey/miradi), which I maintain.  You can download that sample PBIX file there, or quickly view it online from that Project's page.

Other newer file formats e.g. PBIP or PBIR are not supported - "save as" PBIX format to use this solution. Note that using the current preview PBIR format is a one-way conversion - you will not be able to "save as" a PBIR solution back to PBIX in the original format. I do not have any plans to bother trying to support those new formats, I expect PBIX format will always be supported, and continue to be used by the vast majority of Power BI Desktop users.

I welcome any ideas or contributions - please start the discussion by raising a Issue.
